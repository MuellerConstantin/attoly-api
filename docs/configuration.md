# Configuration

The configuration is based on the used Spring Boot framework. For the various configuration options that Spring Boot
offers,
see [Spring Externalized Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config)
.
Usually property files or environment variables are used, the latter should be found in the current working directory.
Basically, the entire application can be personalized via external configuration. Settings relevant to the application
are listed below, for further options please
see [Common Application Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html)
.

Each of the listed properties below can also be configured via environment variables. The name of the environment
variable corresponds to the name of the property in upper case, with the period separator being replaced by an
underscore and dashes are removed. Please
see [Binding From Environment Variables](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables)
for details.

<small>¹In principle, any JPA/Hibernate capable relational database can be used. For this, however, the application must
also have the corresponding drivers as a dependency in the Java Classpath. By default, only the MySQL drivers are
included
with the application.</small>

In addition, the application uses various cron and start up jobs to set up the database and environment. Below are the
options to enable/disable and configure these jobs.
