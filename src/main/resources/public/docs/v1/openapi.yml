    This is the backend of the Attoly URL shortener platform, responsible for
    data storage and exchange. Attoly allows creating short links as aliases
    for long URLs, which are easier to embed in websites, chats and documents.
    
    # Introduction
    This is the official documentation of the Attoly RESTful API. Based on
    simple REST principles, the Attoly RESTful API endpoints return JSON
    metadata about created and managed short link URL mappings aka shortcuts.
    This API also provides access to user related data, like account information
    and your personal shortcut library.
    
    # Overview
    The following settings and techniques apply to the entire Attoly RESTful API.
    
    ## HTTP Verbs
    There are a couple of possible HTTP verbs used for the RESTful API. The following
    table clearly clarifies their use and meaning within the API.
    
    | Verb         | Description                                                       |
    |--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | HEAD         | Can be ran against any resource to get just the HTTP header info. |
    | GET          | Used for retrieving resources.                                    |
    | POST         | Used for creating resources.                                      |
    | PATCH        | Used for updating resources partially.                            |
    | PUT          | Used for replacing resources or collections.                      |
    | DELETE       | Used for deleting resources.                                      |
    
    ## Timestamps
    Timestamps are returned in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
    format with the time zone offset of the server: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sss`.
    The time stamp is always specified with the offset addition in the server's
    time zone. Despite the specification of the fractions of the second, inaccuracies
    can occur with the timestamps in the millisecond range.
    
    ## Pagination
    Some of the queries read from a larger subset of the data set. In these cases,
    pagination is used to avoid performance problems. In general, the pagination
    behaviour is controlled by the query parameters `page` and `perPage`. You can
    specify the page offset with the `page` parameter. For some resources, its is
    also possible set a custom page size with the `perPage` parameter.
    
    ---
    **NOTE**

    The offset numbering is zero-based. Omitting the offset parameter sets the
    requested page to zero by default and returns the first X elements of a
    collection. Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 25
    items by default.
    ---
    
    ## Internationalization
    In principle, this API supports internationalization, but to a limited extent.
    Currently internationalization is supported for error messages and validation
    as well as server-generated responses. By default, the server responds in
    English. If another language is desired, this can be controlled via the
    `Accept-Language` header.
    
    ```
    Accept-Language: en
    ```
    
    At the moment the following languages are supported on the server side:
    - English (en)
    - German (de)
    
    ## Authentication
    Some of the endpoints require authentication to function properly. This applies
    in principle but not exclusively to all user account-related operations.
    Authentication is achieved by a stateless token based authentication mechanism
    that is using the *HTTP Bearer Authentication* scheme.
    
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>
    ```
    
    So-called JWT access tokens are used, which can be requested once in exchange
    for credentials and are now used for authentication instead of email and
    password. There are also opaque refresh tokens that can be used to generate
    new access tokens without having to resend the credentials. This is necessary
    to stay logged in for a longer period of time, as the access tokens have a
    relatively short lifespan.
